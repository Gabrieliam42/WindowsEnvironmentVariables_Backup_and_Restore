# WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Backup_and_Restore

Windows Environment Variables Backup and Restore

* These scripts have self-explanatory names `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Backup.py` and `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Restore.py` have also been compiled as `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Backup.exe` and `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Restore.exe`


- `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Backup` saves all of the Environment Variables in the current working directory as the file `env_vars_backup.json` which you can view with Notepad.

- `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Restore` restores all of the Environment Variables from the `env_vars_backup.json` which should be in the current working directory.

Note: This project saves and restores all of the complete Environment Variables meaning everything from the User Variables and also everything from the System Variables.
Another advantage is that the json file can be edited if there is such a need.
