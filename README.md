Windows Environment Variables Backup and Restore

* These scripts have self-explanatory names `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Backup.py` and `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Restore.py` have also been compiled as `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Backup.exe` and `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Restore.exe`


- `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Backup.exe` saves the Environment Variables in the current working directory as the files `env_system_backup.reg` and `env_system_backup.reg`.

- `WindowsEnvironmentVariables_Restore.exe` restores the Environment Variables from both those `env_system_backup.reg` and `env_system_backup.reg` files which should be in the current working directory.
You can also simply double click each of the .reg files for the restoration.

Note: This project helps you save all of the Environment Variables, and restore them at a later time, so it makes a backup of everything from the User Variables and also everything from the System Variables.
